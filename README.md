The scope of this project is to determine what makes a particular song popular on spotify? To do so we will explore the relationship between various audio features, genres, artists, and their respective track popularities to try and uncover what truly makes a popular track. More specifically, weâ€™ll be focusing on the best and the worst of the tracks on Spotify to see if there are common themes among the two.

Data Sources:

We used a dataset from Kaggle containing over 20,000 tracks with features and YouTube engagement metrics, we pulled recent track popularity data from the Spotify API and merged it with Spotify URLs to create our final dataset.
